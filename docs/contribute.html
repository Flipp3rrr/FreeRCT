		<h1>Contribute</h1>
		<p>
			So you want to help develop FreeRCT? That's great!
		</p><p>
			Development happens on our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT">GitHub repo</a>.
			You need to have an account on GitHub and some basic experience with Git to get started.
			It's not that hard though; <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started">see here</a>
			for a quickstart guide on how to create a free GitHub account and use Git.
		</p><p>
			The game is still in an early stage of development and new contributions are always welcome.
			Just start working on a feature or bugfix and propose it for merging via a pull request (PR) on GitHub.
			If you like, you can announce what you'll work on, but this is not required.
			If you are unsure what to work on, look at the
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT/issues">list of open issues</a>
			for inspiration or ask us for pointers.
		</p>

		<script>create_linkified_header('h2', 'contribute', 'graphics', 'Graphics Design')</script>
		<p>
			Whether you can create 2D graphics for the UI or 3D images for rides and other in-game objects,
			all contributions are welcome. You can enhance or replace existing images, and submit
			graphics for new objects which we'll then include in the game.
		</p>

		<script>create_linkified_header('h2', 'contribute', 'sound', 'Sound & Music')</script>
		<p>
			Okay, FreeRCT doesn't have a sound engine yet, but that's only because we don't
			currently have any sound or music at all.
			If you can design sound effects or compose background music, you're very welcome to
			create and submit some, and we'll integrate them into the game.
		</p>

		<script>create_linkified_header('h2', 'contribute', 'translating', 'Translating')</script>
		<p>
			The source language of FreeRCT is British English (<tt>en_GB</tt>).
			All strings are defined in <tt>graphics/rcd/lang/&lt;LANGUAGE_CODE&gt;.txt</tt>.
			Enhancing translations for an existing language as well as adding a new language
			is as easy as opening/creating the respective file for your language
			and editing the strings therein.
		</p>

		<script>create_linkified_header('h2', 'contribute', 'testing', 'Testing')</script>
		<p>
			Even if you can't contribute code or art, you're welcome to test FreeRCT and hunt for bugs.
			Just check out the latest development version with Git, compile, and run.
			Report any bugs you encounter on the
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT/issues">issue tracker</a>
			(you need a GitHub account for this). You can also test
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT/pulls">open PRs</a>.
			In this case, bugs should be reported in the PR, not on the issue tracker.
			The PR description will tell you what to watch out for specifically.
		</p><p>
			New screenshots for the website's <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots section</a>
			are also always appreciated.
		</p>

		<script>create_linkified_header('h2', 'contribute', 'website', 'Website Scripting')</script>
		<p>
			You're welcome to improve this website in every way you can think of.
		</p><p>
			The site is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is currently hosted by <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub Pages</a>,
			which means that it is a static site which can not use PHP, Python, or other server-side logic.
			Hopefully we will one day have our own server and domain where we can enhance the website with
			interactive content such as a players' forum, an upload/download section for user-made content, and much moreâ€¦
		</p>

		<script>create_linkified_header('h2', 'contribute', 'coding', 'Coding For FreeRCT')</script>
		<p>
			The FreeRCT engine is coded in C++ using SDL2.
			Rides and other units are defined in a custom language called the RCD file format.
		</p><p>
			Please provide Doxygen documentation for your C++ patches.
			If your feature requires new graphics, it is acceptable to create simple placeholder
			pics until someone else creates final images.
		</p><p>
			You can find more information in the <tt>doc/</tt> folder of the Git checkout.
			In the future, this information will be available here on the website as well.
