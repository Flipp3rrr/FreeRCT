		<h1>Contributing</h1>
		<p>
			So you want to help develop FreeRCT? That's great!
		</p> <p>
			Development happens on our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT">GitHub repo</a>.
			You need to have an account on GitHub and some basic experience with Git to get started.
			It's not that hard though; <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started">see here</a>
			for a quickstart guide on how to create a free GitHub account and use Git.
		</p> <p>
			The FreeRCT engine is coded in C++ using SDL2.
			Rides and other units are defined in a custom language called the RCD file format.
			We need developers for every aspect of the game â€“
			C++ coders, 2D and 3D graphic artists, sound effect creators, website scripters, and testers.
		</p> <p>
			The game is still in an early stage of development and new contributions are always welcome.
			Just start working on a feature or bugfix and propose it for merging via a pull request (PR) on GitHub.
			If you like, you can announce what you'll work on, but this is not required.
			If you are unsure what to work on, look at the
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT/issues">list of open issues</a>
			for inspiration or ask us for pointers.
		</p> <p>
			Please provide Doxygen documentation for your C++ patches.
			If your feature requires new graphics, it is acceptable to create simple placeholder pics until someone else creates final images.
		</p> <p>
			Even if you can't contribute code or art, you're welcome to test FreeRCT and hunt for bugs.
			Just check out the latest development version with Git, compile, and run.
			Report any bugs you encounter on the
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT/issues">issue tracker</a>
			(you need a GitHub account for this). You can also test
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT/pulls">open PRs</a>.
			In this case, bugs should be reported in the PR, not on the issue tracker.
			The PR description will tell you what to watch out for specifically.
		</p> <p>
			You can find more information in the <tt>doc/</tt> folder of the Git checkout.
			In the future, this information will be available here on the website as well.
