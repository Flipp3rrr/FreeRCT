		<h1>Game Manual</h1>

		<!-- TODO Add a table of contents. -->

		<p>
			In FreeRCT, you are the manager of a pleasure park. You build everything that your guests need to be happy:
			most importantly, rollercoasters and other rides, but also food stalls, footpaths, flowerbeds,
			and everything else that will make your guests love your park and spend lots of money there.
		</p><p>
			Additionally, you oversee the park's administration: Set the entrance fees on rides, hire and fire staff,
			take and repay loans, and even design your very own rollercoasters!
		</p><p>
			A wise manager will lead their park to fame and fortune; those less fortunate will go under
			amid dirty paths, vandalising guests, and crashing coasters. Which one will be your fate?
		</p>

		<h2>Downloading And Installing</h2>
			<p>

				</p>



		<h2>The Game Window</h2>
			<p>
				The game window is divided into three areas. In the center of the window is the <emp>main view</emp>,
				which displays your park.
				At the top of the window is the <emp>toolbar</emp>, which contains all the buttons and controls to manage both the park and FreeRCT.
				At the bottom of the window is the <emp>info panel</emp>, which shows information about your park.
			</p>

			<h3>The Main View</h3>
				<p>
					The main view displays the game world.
					You can navigate around by right-click-and-dragging.
					Use the Left and Right arrow keys to rotate the view in 90° steps.
					You can click on things (rides, guests, …) to open windows which display
					more information about the item as well as management options.
				</p>

			<h3>The Toolbar</h3>
				<p>
					The toolbar buttons, from left to right, mean:

					</ul>
				</p>

			<h3>The Info Panel</h3>
				<p>
					In the upper left corner of the info panel you can see the amount of <emp>cash</emp> your park currently has.
					Below it is the number of <emp>guests</emp> in the park.
					To the right of these figures is an indicator of the current <emp>weather</emp> in the park, ranging from sunny to thunderstorm,
					with the <emp>temperature</emp> next to it.
					At the right edge of the info panel is the current in-game <emp>date</emp>.
					The <emp>compass</emp> to its left indicates the current rotation of your main view (the red arrow points north).
					The large empty space in the middle of the info panel is where any <emp>messages</emp> you receive are previewed.
				</p>

		<h2>Building Basic Infrastructure</h2>
			<h3>Footpaths</h3>
				<p>
					Your guests will move only on footpaths. To build footpaths, click on the 
					<emp>Paths</emp> button in the top toolbar and select a
					<emp>normal path</emp> type. Now click anywhere in your park and a footpath
					will appear. Right-click on an existing footpath to remove it.
					Building paths costs money and may only be performed if you still have
					enough cash. Deleting paths returns cash, but less than it cost to build the path.
				</p><p>
					At the bottom of the window, you can switch between <emp>single</emp> and
					<emp>directional</emp> path building mode. In single mode, a click
					corresponds to placing one tile of path. You can place paths only on flat terrain
					and suitably formed slopes. In directional mode, you can also build elevated
					paths. Click on the map to position the path building cursor there. Now use
					the four yellow arrowbutton in the path building window to choose a direction,
					and the three slope buttons to choose the angle. Finally, click the <emp>Buy</emp>
					button to build a path in the location indicated by the cursor. The cursor
					automatically advances one step forward so you can build a longer path quickly.
					Using the <emp>Remove</emp> button removes the last path segment and moves the
					cursor one step backwards.
				</p><p>
					Queues for rides can be built in the same manner as normal paths.
					Just select a <emp>queue path</emp> type instead of a <emp>normal path</emp>.
					You will learn morw about queues in the <emp>Rides</emp> section below.
				</p>

			<h3>Path Objects</h3>
				<p>
					Those paths are a bit bare, aren't they? Let's add some path objects.
					To do so, click the <emp>Path Objects</emp> button in the top toolbar.
				</p><p>
					There are three types of path objects available:
					<ul>
						     <li> <emp>Benches</emp> allow guests to sit down and rest.
						          This makes the guests happy and serves to reduce nausea and
						          tiredness. Two guests can sit on each bench. Benches can only
						          be built on flat paths.
						</li><li> <emp>Litterbins</emp> are used by guests to throw away wrappers
						          from food they bought. If a guest can't find a litterbin to dispose
						          of his litter, he will simply throw it down, so make sure there
						          are enough bins around! When a lot of litter has been thrown in
						          a bin, the bin needs to be emptied by a handyman before guests
						          can dispose of more litter there.
						</li><li> <emp>Lamps</emp> look nice. They don't have a
						          function beyond decorating your park.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p><p>
					Like almost everything in this game, path objects cost money to build.
					To build a path object, select it in the Path Objects window and click on an
					existing footpath. <emp>All</emp> edges of this footpath are immediately
					furnished with the selected object. Any other path object previously present
					will be replaced.
				</p>

			<h3>Scenery</h3>
				<p>
					Most of your park is just a featureless green plain. How about adding some trees, flowers,
					and other scenery? To do so, click the <emp>Scenery</emp> button in the top toolbar.
				</p><p>
					The Scenery window looks and behaves much like the Path Objects window.
					However, there are more items available for purchase, so they're grouped into
					categories. Use the tab buttons at the top of the window to switch between the categories.
					Click on an item to select it, then click on the map to buy it.
					Scenery items can not be built on slopes.
					Some items occupy just one field, but some occupy several. For items that are
					not symmetrical, the two <emp>Rotate</emp> buttons in the top-right corner of
					the Scenery window allow you to choose the orientation of the item you're about to buy.
				</p><p>
					Right-click on an existing scenery item to remove it. Some items (e.g.
					fountains) will return cash on removal, while others (such as trees)
					actually cost more money to get rid of.
				</p>

			<h3>Terraforming</h3>
				<p>
					The landscape is still looking a tad boring. Some hills or cliffs would be nice.
					To add some, click the <emp>Landscaping</emp> button in the top toolbar.
				</p><p>
					The Landscaping window has two important settings.
					On the right are two buttons to increase and decrease the size of the area you will terraform.
					Below is the option whether to level the area or move it as a whole.
				</p><p>
					Modifying the landscape is as easy as moving the mouse over the park so the cursor
					indicates the area you want to edit and then using the <emp>mouse wheel</emp>
					to move the area up or down.
				</p><p>
					If the size of the terraforming cursor is just a single tile,
					you can also point at the corner of a tile to modify just a quarter tile.
				</p><p>
					If the size of the terraforming cursor is just a single dot,
					it behaves like the single tile cursor with one exception: In this mode,
					surrounding tiles will be dragged along with the tile or corner you're
					editing, allowing you to create large hills or valleys without cliffs quickly.
				</p>

			<h3>Fences</h3>
				<p>
					If you played around with the various tools, your park should have a pretty
					nice landscape by now. For the finushing touch, click the
					<emp>Fences</emp> button in the top toolbar.
				</p><p>
					Building fences is as easy as it can get: Select one of the three fence
					types, then click on the map to build a fence segment.
				</p><p>
					Building fences is currently free, but unfortunately a way to remove them
					once placed has not been implemented yet.
				</p>


		<h2>Rides</h2>
			<!-- TODO -->
			<p style="text-align: center"><emp>This section is still under construction.</emp></p>

			<p>
				Rides are the most important aspect of your park. So let's see how to build and manage them.
			</p>

				</p><p>
					
				</p>

		<h2>Park Administration</h2>
			<h3>Staff</h3>
				<p>
					Hiring staff is an important aspect of keeping your park functional.
					Click the <emp>Staff</emp> button in the top toolbar to open the staff window.
				</p><p>
					There are four types of staff for your park:
					<ul>
						     <li> <emp>Handymen</emp> take care of sweeping dirty paths, emptying full
						          litterbins, watering the flowerbeds, and mowing the lawns.
						</li><li> <emp>Mechanics</emp> repair broken rides, and inspect rides
						          frequently to reduce the likelihood of breakdowns.
						</li><li> <emp>Security guards</emp> prevent nearby guests from demolishing path objects.
						</li><li> <emp>Entertainers</emp> increase the happiness and patience of nearby guests.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p><p>
					Select one of the four tabs in the staff window to see how many of this staff
					you currently have, what they're doing right now, and how high their monthly
					salary is. Use the <emp>Hire</emp> button to hire more staff.
					You can click on any staff member to open his personal information window.
					Next to each staff member is a black cross that allows you to dismiss him instantly.
				</p>

			<h3>Inbox</h3>
				<p>
					FreeRCT occasionally sends you a message to inform you about important events
					such as availability of new ride types, common complaints, awards won, and more.
					The newest message is previewed in the bottom toolbar. The <emp>Inbox</emp>
					button in the top toolbar opens a list of all messages your park ever received.
				</p>

			<h3>Finances</h3>
				<p>
					The <emp>Finances</emp> button in the top toolbar shows you details
					about your monthly earnings and spendings. Administrative controls, a
					history, and further statistics such as park value are not yet implemented.
				</p>

			<h3>Personal Information Windows</h3>
				<p>
					You can click on any person – guest or staff – in the main view
					to open a window displaying personal information about them.
					Staff can also be dismissed via a button in this window.
				</p>
